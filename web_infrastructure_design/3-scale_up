### **Infrastructure Design**

The goal is to create a robust and scalable infrastructure where components (web server, application server, and database) are split across their own servers, with an additional load balancer for high availability. Below is a breakdown of the required components and the reasoning behind each addition.

---

### **1. Web Server**
**Purpose**:  
The web server handles HTTP requests from clients (browsers, APIs) and serves static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. It forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

**Technology Choice**:  
You could use popular web servers like **Nginx** or **Apache HTTP Server**. Nginx is preferred for high performance and handling concurrent connections efficiently.

**Reason for Addition**:  
- Separation of concerns: Keeps static content delivery and request handling optimized, reducing the workload on the application server.
- Security: Acts as a first layer of defense, with configurations for SSL/TLS termination, request filtering, etc.

### **2. Application Server**
**Purpose**:  
Processes business logic, handles API calls, and interacts with the database. This is where frameworks (e.g., Django, Spring Boot, Express.js) run.

**Technology Choice**:  
An application server like **Gunicorn** for Python or **Tomcat** for Java could be used. 

**Reason for Addition**:  
- Scalability: Application servers are optimized for running backend logic, enabling scaling without affecting the web serverâ€™s performance.
- Decoupling: Keeps backend logic separate from the web server, making maintenance easier.

### **3. Database Server**
**Purpose**:  
Stores persistent data for the application. Queries are handled here for retrieving and storing information.

**Technology Choice**:  
Use a relational database like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**, or a NoSQL database like **MongoDB** if the application requires schema flexibility.

**Reason for Addition**:  
- Data Integrity: Centralized data management ensures consistency.
- Performance: Separating the database from the application server ensures queries don't slow down the backend logic.

### **4. Load Balancer**
**Purpose**:  
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure availability and reliability.

**Technology Choice**:  
**HAProxy** is a popular choice for a load balancer due to its performance and extensive configuration options.

**Configuration**:  
- Set up in **cluster mode** for failover.
- Distributes traffic between web servers or application servers (depending on architecture).

**Reason for Addition**:  
- **High Availability**: Ensures the application remains accessible even if one server fails.
- **Scalability**: Allows the system to handle more traffic by distributing the load across multiple servers.

           | Application Servers|
           +--------------------+
                     |
                     v
           +--------------------+
           | Database Server    |
           +--------------------+
```

### **Why This Architecture?**
1. **Modularity**: Each component is isolated, making it easier to debug, maintain, and scale.
2. **Scalability**: Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers, allowing horizontal scaling.
3. **Reliability**: Clustering ensures no single point of failure (e.g., the load balancer or application server).
4. **Performance**: Specialized servers optimize resource usage (e.g., web servers handle static files, application servers focus on business logic).
